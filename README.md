# MyDevOpsRepo
This is a repo for devops

This project illustrates on how to build GitHub repository from the very beginning and creating a scaffolding that will assist in performing both Continuous integration and Continuous Delivery. The process followed the pathway below

 . Creating Github Actions together with a Makefile and a requirement.txt file
 . Application code to perform initial lint, test and install cycle.
 . Lastly integrating the project with Azure Pipelines to enable Continuous Delivery to Azure App Servi

Architectural Diagram (Shows how key parts of the system work)>
<TODO: Instructions for running the Python project. How could a user with no context run this project without asking you for any help. Include screenshots with explicit steps to create that work. Be sure to at least include the following screenshots:

Project running on Azure App Service

Project cloned into Azure Cloud Shell

Passing tests that are displayed after running the make all command from the Makefile

Output of a test run

Successful deploy of the project in Azure Pipelines. Note the official documentation should be referred to and double checked as you setup CI/CD.

Running Azure App Service from Azure Pipelines automatic deployment

Successful prediction from deployed flask app in Azure Cloud Shell. Use this file as a template for the deployed prediction. The output should look similar to this:

udacity@Azure:~$ ./make_predict_azure_app.sh
Port: 443
{"prediction":[20.35373177134412]}
Output of streamed log files from deployed application
